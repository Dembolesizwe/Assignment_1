We have 2 seperate files we need to compile, combine and then run. 
The following can be pasted into the terminal directly and run to complete this. 

Compile the code in the source and header files into the executable file using this line in terminal
g++ Assignment1.2/src/*.cpp -iquote Assignment1.2/include -o assignment1.2.exe

To run the file use the following line
.\assignment1.2.exe
